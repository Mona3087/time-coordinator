This project consists of an asynchronous chatbot application that processes CSV files uploaded by users. The chatbot provides real-time interaction to manage and process data from the CSV files.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Prompts users to upload a CSV file at the start of a session.
- **Character Count**: Notifies the user of the number of characters in the uploaded CSV file.
- **Data Processing**: Processes messages using the content of the uploaded CSV file to generate responses.
